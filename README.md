NodeDash
========

An open-source NodeJS and AngularJS-powered server monitoring dashboard solution.

This is a very early version of NodeDash that I'm putting up on GitHub to have it in a safe spot.
This code is free to use, but abandoned.

### Installation
Just use `npm install node-dash`.

### Usage
Examples can be found in the `examples/` folder.
A full API reference will be up soon.
